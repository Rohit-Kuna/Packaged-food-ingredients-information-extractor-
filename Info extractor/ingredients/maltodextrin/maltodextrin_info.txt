---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a highly processed type of carbohydrate. It is mostly present in the packaged food extracted from natural sources, such as corn, rice, potato, wheat, and some other plants. Starches from these foods undergo a complex chemical process that involves cooking the starch at a very high temperature and mixing it with chemicals until they're broken down into a neutral-tasting powder. It is artificially produced and can be found in several different foods, such as artificial sweeteners, baked goods, yogurt, beer, nutrition bars, weight-training supplements, cereals, meal-replacement shakes, low-fat and reduced-calorie products, condiments, sauces, spice mixes, salad dressings, chips, pie fillings, and snack foods. It is used to improve the consistency, texture, and taste of the food item. Basically, maltodextrins are a group of carbohydrate entities (sugars) resulting from the more or less partial hydrolysis of starch.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), maltodextrin is listed as a GRAS (generally recognized as safe) food additive; however, one may still need to be careful. If excessive amounts are consumed, it can cause health conditions. Maltodextrin is extremely bad for metabolism because it lacks nutritional value and may also spike your blood sugars. The dangers of excessive intake of maltodextrin include:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Is maltodextrin a rich source of energy?
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Yes, companies use it in relatively large quantities in sports drinks and energy drinks. They bill it as a constant source of energy for athletes. It can provide fuel for muscles and help to get a better workout. It will also give you a quick boost in energy straight away. So, it can be useful for athletes. However, it is only recommended for people who are training hard. Unless an individual is exercising for an hour at a time, there is usually no physical need for that much energy.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---How to limit maltodextrin?
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---To minimize the effects of maltodextrin, it may be combined with some fiber or protein that will help in slow digestion. People may need to avoid processed foods with additives, because of their impact on the body especially those who have difficulty digesting sugars from plants. It’s also best to eat low on the food chain to limit the consumption of maltodextrin. Fruits, veggies, grains, fish, chicken, beef, pork, tofu, and beans are better alternatives. Another great idea is to try using or consuming products that contain maltodextrin alternatives, such as stevia, honey, and dates. Look for products that have these better alternatives and make sure to read the labels before purchasing.

Maltodextrin is a white, starchy powder that manufacturers add into many foods to improve their flavor, thickness, or shelf life.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a common ingredient in packaged foods, such as pastries, candies, and soft drinks. When it is present, it will usually feature on the food label. Athletes may also use maltodextrin as a carbohydrate supplement.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many people believe that maltodextrin is harmful to health. But how much truth is there to these claims?
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Read on to learn about the benefits and dangers of maltodextrin and which foods contain this ingredient.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a white powder that is relatively tasteless and dissolves in water. It is an additive in a wide range of foods, as it can improve their texture, flavor, and shelf life.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It is possible to make maltodextrin from any starchy food, including corn, potato, wheat, tapioca, or rice. Although the powder comes from these natural products, it then undergoes processing.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---To make maltodextrin, manufacturers put starch through a process called hydrolysis. Hydrolysis uses water, enzymes, and acids to break the starch into smaller pieces, resulting in a white powder consisting of sugar molecules.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---People with celiac disease should be aware that maltodextrin can contain traces of gluten when wheat is the source of the starch. However, according to the Beyond Celiac charity, maltodextrin is gluten-free as long as the ingredients list does not include the word wheat.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---In edible products, this powder can help by:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin has no nutritional value. However, it is a very easy-to-digest carbohydrate and can provide energy rapidly. Due to this, manufacturers add this powder to many sports drinks and snacks.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many people eat maltodextrin every day without realizing. Foods that often contain maltodextrin include:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Some manufacturers also add maltodextrin to lotions, hair-care products, and livestock feed.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), maltodextrin is a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) food additive.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---However, if a person eats too many products that contain maltodextrin, their diet is likely to be high in sugar, low in fiber, and full of highly processed foods. This type of diet can increase a person’s risk of high cholesterol, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Research has also linked maltodextrin with possible health risks. These include the following:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin has an even higher glycemic index (GI) than table sugar. This means that maltodextrin can cause a sharp increase, or spike, in people’s blood sugar shortly after they eat foods that contain it.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---A spike in blood glucose can be particularly dangerous for people with diabetes or insulin resistance.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---A high GI means that the sugars in these foods will quickly enter the bloodstream, where the body will absorb them. In contrast, complex carbohydrates, which include beans and whole-wheat pasta, are more healthful because the body absorbs them slowly. This makes people feel full for a more extended period.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Evidence suggests that maltodextrin may affect the balance of gut bacteria, which play an important role in people’s health.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Although studies in humans are necessary to confirm this, initial research on mice suggests that people who consume maltodextrin may have a reduced number of good bacteria and an increased quantity of harmful bacteria. This could potentially lead to intestine damage and a higher risk of inflammatory bowel diseases.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---One study has shown that maltodextrin increases the activity of Escherichia coli bacteria, which may have a role in the development of the inflammatory bowel disease known as Crohn’s disease.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Another study has linked maltodextrin to the survival of Salmonella bacteria, which may cause gastroenteritis and a broad range of chronic inflammatory conditions.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---A recent study suggested that maltodextrin may also compromise the ability of cells to respond to bacteria. It could also suppress intestine defense mechanisms against them, leading to intestinal disorders.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many food additives can cause allergies or intolerances. Side effects may include allergic reactions, weight gain, gas, flatulence, and bloating.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin may also cause a rash or skin irritation, asthma, cramping, or difficulty breathing.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The primary sources of maltodextrin will be corn, rice, and potato, but manufacturers may sometimes use wheat. People with celiac disease or gluten intolerance should be aware that, although the production process will remove most of the protein components, maltodextrin derived from wheat may still contain some gluten.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---GM corn, which is a genetically modified organism (GMO), is a common source of maltodextrin.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The World Health Organization (WHO) state that GMOs are safe to consume.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---However, GMOs may be harmful to the environment or people’s health because of the increased use of herbicides and pesticides on GMO crops. There is also a chance that the genetically modified material can get into wild plants and animals, or into the human body through the diet.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many people believe that there is a link between GMOs and various health conditions, including cancer, kidney problems, Alzheimer’s disease, antibiotic resistance, allergies, and reproductive issues.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---There is little evidence that this is true, though some believe that the lack of evidence could be partly due to the censorship of GMO research. The Environmental Sciences Europe journal published an article in support of this theory.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a cheap and effective food product that can improve the texture, taste, and shelf life of foods.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many athletes and people who want to gain muscle or body weight use products containing maltodextrin as it is a rapid source of energy.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---People who are concerned about their maltodextrin intake may wish to choose alternative foods that provide healthful nutrients. This can help people to avoid blood glucose spikes.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Other food additives that thicken or stabilize foods include guar binding gum and pectin, which is a carbohydrate that manufacturers extract from fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Manufacturers may also use tapioca starch and arrowroot starch as thickeners.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---People should also look out for flavoring alternatives to maltodextrin on product labels. These include sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol and erythritol, and sweeteners, such as stevia.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Sugar alcohols have fewer calories than maltodextrin and a lower impact on blood sugar levels. However, some people may find that they cause bloating and flatulence.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Stevia has no calories and little effect on blood sugar levels. However, some products include a blend of stevia and either maltodextrin or dextrose, and this blend can affect blood sugar levels.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---People use maltodextrin as an artificial food additive or a carbohydrate supplement to boost energy levels and performance.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Experts consider it to be safe for the majority of people, although it may also carry some risks, particularly for people with diabetes. People may prefer to choose products that use alternative food additives, such as pectin.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Eating too many processed foods with additives can cause health problems. Instead, it is best to aim for a more healthful diet of whole-grains and vegetables to boost gut, brain, and heart health.

If you regularly check the ingredients in your processed or packaged foods, you might have seen maltodextrin in them. Food makers add it to a wide variety of foods, like:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The FDA lists the product among the generally safe food additives.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a type of carbohydrate, but it undergoes intense processing. It comes in the form of a white powder from rice, corn, wheat, or potato starch. Its makers first cook it, then add acids or enzymes to break it down some more. The final product is a water-soluble white powder with a neutral taste. The powder is used as an additive in the foods above to replace sugar and improve their texture, shelf life, and taste.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---If you have celiac disease, be careful about eating foods with maltodextrin. The powder has traces of gluten if its source is wheat.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---If you eat too many foods containing maltodextrin, your diet's quality is likely to be below par. You will get too much sugar and low amounts of fiber. Such diets will increase your risk of type 2 diabetes, weight gain, and high cholesterol.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
‌Maltodextrin and diabetes. The glycemic index (GI) in maltodextrin is higher than in table sugar. This means that the powder can cause a spike in your blood sugar shortly after eating foods that have it. A sudden increase in blood glucose in people with insulin resistance or diabetes can be fatal.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---A high GI means that foods quickly enter the bloodstream and the body quickly absorbs them. This increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Complex carbohydrates don’t pose this danger as the body takes time to absorb them. You also tend to feel fuller for a longer time.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
Maltodextrin and gut bacteria. Maltodextrin may affect the balance of bacteria in the gut. Research in its early stages suggests that maltodextrin may reduce the number of good bacteria and increase the harmful bacteria. This can cause damage to the intestine and increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. The powder may also enhance the survival of salmonella bacteria. It causes gastroenteritis and other inflammatory conditions.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
May cause allergic reactions. If you consume maltodextrin in large amounts, this may cause gastrointestinal symptoms. These include gas, gurgling sounds, and diarrhea. Studies show that it can cause allergic reactions like cramping and skin irritations. The process of making the powder removes all protein, including gluten, but traces may still be found. This can be dangerous for you if you have gluten intolerance or celiac disease.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
May cause weight gain. Maltodextrin is a simple carbohydrate that provides you with no nutritional value. Consuming it in high amounts can lead to weight gain.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
Source of energy. Maltodextrin can be a quick source of energy. One gram contains four calories, the same amount as table sugar or sucrose. The body digests the powder quickly to help you get some fuel for your muscles. This explains why companies use it in large quantities in making energy drinks and sports drinks. People who work out can benefit from the product after hard workouts to restore their blood sugar levels.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---
May fight colorectal cancer. A form of maltodextrin — Fibersol-2 — is effective in preventing human colorectal tumor cell growth. This could be because it promotes bacterial fermentation and improves digestion.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The disadvantages of maltodextrin outnumber the benefits, especially if you have a sensitive digestive system. There are healthier alternatives that can add flavor, act as binding ingredients, and help restore energy levels:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Experts consider maltodextrin a safe product for consumption, but it may carry some risks. If you have diabetes or celiac disease, use healthier alternatives to the product. Avoid eating highly processed foods, and instead choose whole grains and vegetables to boost brain, gut, and heart health.

---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a complex carbohydrate found on the ingredients list of many store-bought foods, but there’s a good chance you either haven’t noticed it or that you don’t know what it is.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---At a glance, it is a food additive that also serves as a great source of energy for athletes in need of a quick hit of carbs.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---So what is it, and is it good for your health?
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is made from corn, potato starch, rice, and sometimes wheat. Its production consists of cooking the aforementioned starches before adding acid and sometimes enzymes, for example, bacterial alpha-amylase, which helps to break it down.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The difference between maltodextrin and corn syrup solids also comes from how they are made. Both are put through the process of hydrolysis, which is a chemical process that involves adding water to help to further break them down. The difference is, after hydrolysis, maltodextrin is less than 20 percent sugar, while corn syrup solids are at least 20 percent sugar.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It often features in processed food as a kind of thickener that increases the volume of the processed food. Because it is cheap to make and so easily produced it is often combined with artificial sweeteners in desserts and powdered drinks. Sometimes it is even used in hair and skin care products.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Hardgainers, this one is for you. For athletes and bodybuilders, maltodextrin can be a top source of fast calories and energy. It is often found in sports drinks designed to help sportsmen gain weight.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---For people living with hypoglycaemia, maltodextrin is often prescribed as a part of regular treatment due to its ability to quickly increase a subject’s blood sugar levels, meaning that if they struggle to maintain normal blood sugar levels it can be a quick fix solution.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin and dextrose are sugar supplements that are available in powder form that are easily added to, and often already found in many mass building and recovery shakes. Both make carbs readily available to you after and during a workout.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Essentially they are the same in many ways. Dextrose is a simpler form of sugar that your body doesn’t need to break down, while maltodextrin features a string of glucose molecules, which can be easily broken down, but not quite as quickly as dextrose.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on the list of ‘Generally Recognized as Safe’ substances. By ingesting easily digested carbs after a brutal workout – especially one geared to develop mass muscle – you will do your body justice in helping it to recover. This will also help your body to build muscle more effectively by stimulating a release of insulin, which helps nutrients get where you want them to go in your body. It also means that you can get back training sooner.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a highly processed white powder substance that is similar to corn syrup solids. It is absorbed directly into your guts, raising blood sugar and insulin levels. You probably know already that many processed foods are made in a way that gives them a longer shelf life. Well, maltodextrin is the reason for that, too.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It has around four calories per gram, rivalling the average table sugar. Maltodextrin’s GI ranges from 106 to 136, making it higher than table sugar. GI is a substance’s glycaemic index, which is a figure that states the ability of a carb to increase the level of glucose in your blood. Your body can digest maltodextrin quickly, which makes it a highly effective and readily available quick boost of energy and calories when it’s required.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---For anyone concerned about fat and cholesterol, it is believed that because of its zero content, maltodextrin does not lead to fat gains. It also does not feature sodium, potassium, protein, calcium, iron or vitamins.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a white powder with no sweetness that is used as a food additive, often in processed foods and in sports drinks. It is beneficial to anyone taking on rigorous endurance or muscle building exercise as it provides a quickly absorbed intake of carbs, which contribute to the recovery of your normal muscle function. This can help ward off the effects of muscle fatigue, but also can help with muscle growth following a workout.

---endofparagraph@rohit1234---******benefits of maltodextrin*******:	******https://greatist.com/health/maltodextrin-dangers******

Whether or not you have any idea what maltodextrin is, there’s a very good chance you’ve consumed some of it in the last 24 hours.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is commonly spotted hiding near the bottom of ingredient lists of packaged or processed foods. It’s a white, powdery, nearly flavorless starch derived from rice, corn, potatoes, or wheat. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It’s a fast-digesting carbohydrate, and a versatile additive that preserves flavors in processed foods. It also thickens food, mimics fat content, and prolongs shelf life.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---To make maltodextrin, starches from these foods are subjected to a process called hydrolysis, in which they’re broken down through chemical reactions with water, aided by additional enzymes and acids.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---So, it’s used as a preservative or a food thickener — does this mean it should be avoided at all costs? 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is considered generally safe to eat by the FDA. In fact, maltodextrins are also produced in the intestine when we digest starchy foods. They have the same calorie density as sugars and carbohydrates.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Read on to get the details on this ingredient.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The FDA affirms maltodextrin as a food that’s “generally recognized as safe.” 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrins are used to replace sugar or fat in many food products such as ice cream, dried instant food formulations, sweets, cereals, snacks, and beverages. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Given that these foods are widely consumed, they may be in your daily diet. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is considered high on the glycemic index, with a score between 80–120, meaning it raises blood sugar about the same as glucose. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Because it’s found in many processed foods, a diet high in maltodextrin is likely also high in sugar and salt, and low in fiber. Such a diet can lead to weight gain, higher levels of cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It’s always better to start with the bad news — that way it can only get better. Here are some potential concerns about maltodextrin:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin may be made from corn, and it’s increasingly harder to find corn that hasn’t been genetically modified. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---While the FDA insists that GM crops are just as safe as traditional ones, there are some people who feel strongly about avoiding products made from GM corn. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---There may be concerns for those with food sensitivities, particularly those with inflammatory bowel disease. Signs of intolerance to maltodextrin include bloating, cramping, and possible diarrhea.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---The gut is a delicate ecosystem of bacteria, and the balance can be upset by what goes in. Some very unwelcome bacteria happen to thrive on maltodextrin and other processed carbohydrates and sugars, including:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is a carbohydrate, so it has the same waist-expanding properties you’d encounter in a piece of white bread. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It’s generally found in pastas, frozen dinners, cereals, desserts, instant foods — all things to limit for the weight-conscious.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Maltodextrin is the same as table sugar on the glycemic index, which means eating an excess can cause a spike in blood sugar. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---So, although it’s tolerable in low doses, those with diabetes should try to limit those processed snack foods where maltodextrins are common. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Any of the following symptoms after eating a food containing maltodextrin could point to higher blood sugar levels:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---In a nutshell, limiting processed foods and eating more whole foods with higher fiber content is the way to go.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Here’s a view of its good angle, under just the right light. Redeeming qualities of maltodextrin include:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Most maltodextrin is derived from corn, but even versions derived from wheat are normally gluten-free, since the gluten is removed during the manufacturing process.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Think of this as the upside of maltodextrin’s high glycemic index score.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Studies have shown that fast-digesting carbs like maltodextrin help to quickly replenish your stores of glycogen — a form of glucose stored in the muscles that acts as a reserve energy supply if blood glucose is depleted.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---This means it’s effective for recovering endurance after or between workouts.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Once again, maltodextrin’s high glycemic index comes to the rescue! Those with chronic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can use it to quickly raise blood sugar in a pinch.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---A 2015 study found that a digestion-resistant form of maltodextrin called Fibersol-2 was effective at significantly inhibiting human colorectal tumor cell growth. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---There are two theories for why this is so — it may be that bacterial fermentation caused by the presence of the maltodextrin is responsible, and it may be due to improvements in digestion attributed to maltodextrin (see below).
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Research also shows that digestion-resistant maltodextrin helps to relieve constipation and support regular bowel function — it generally keeps things moving. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It’s also listed as an ingredient in popular fiber supplements Metamucil and Citrucel. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---This may seem contradictory, given the previously-mentioned research linking maltodextrin to bowel disease, but the concerns lie mostly with the easily digested form of maltodextrin.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Again, maltodextrin is added to foods in order to:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Some common foods that may include maltodextrin are:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---It’s even found in non-food products such as:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many other additives exist with properties similar to maltodextrin, most of which are considered safe unless you’re sensitive to sugar alcohols.
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Some alternatives include:
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Many things in life have pros and cons, and maltodextrin is no exception. But it’s generally a good idea to avoid many of the processed foods it’s found in, for reasons beyond maltodextrin content. 
---endofparagraph@rohit1234---Whether you choose to consume it, include it as a digestive aid, or use it to pump up your athletic endurance, is a good topic of discussion with your doctor or nutritionist.
